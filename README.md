# Gesture Navigator
Gesture Navigator is an experimental/educational project which aims to allow computer gestures to be performed visually. This project attempts to use Computer Vision using a CNN model
to recognize gestures from a video stream (e.g. webcam) and trigger the appropriate gesture action in the operating system (Windows for now). Gesture Navigator hopes to 
demonstrate the applications of Computer Vision to advancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and sees potential in use cases such as touchless navigation, holographic displays, and accessible navigation.
